# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of the Project
To assist Louise to help her understand different success rates and factors that affects them. 

## Purpose
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends to help Louise in her new play 'Fever'. We will be using graphs and 
data to visualize her rate of success adn failure. We will also explore how setting a monitary goal can help her succeed. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Above is the screen shot of the first few rows of the 4000 campaigns that we have put into an excel sheet. We are able to 
adjust and sort the data set based on dates and other factors. We had to ensure the dates are in the correct format, and also category are separated into Catagory and SubCatagory for filtering. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

First conclusion is that during mid year, the rate of success is relatively higher as compared to the rest of the year. 
Second conclusion is that during end of year, the count of successes is very low. Thus Mid year is the most suitable timing. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

After reviewing the outcome based on goals grpah, I realize that most of them have their goals set between $1000 and $4999, and the success rate is up to 73%. This is the most stable goal range. 
The higher we set the goal, the higher chances we have of failure. 

### Result
After analyzing the data set and graphs, we recommend Louise to launch her new play between April and May, and also to definitely avoid launching it at the end of the year. 
Also, we would recommand Louise to set her goal between $5000 to $9999. This is to ensure that she gets profit for her launch, and also ensuring the rate of success at the same time.
